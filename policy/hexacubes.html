        <p>Max van der Heijden operates the Hexacubes mobile application (hereinafter referred to as "Service"). This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <h3>Usage Data</h3> 
        <p>When you access the Service, I may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p> 
        
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
        <p>The app does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their services.</p>
          
        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
        <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate my Service ("Service Providers"), provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or assist us in analysing how our Service is used.</p>

                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <div><p>
                    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                    me with personal information, I immediately
                    delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                    and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                    personal information, please contact me so that
                    I will be able to do the necessary actions.
                  </p></div> <!----> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
