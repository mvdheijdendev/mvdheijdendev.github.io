        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated on March 21, 2023</p>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the Hexacubes mobile application ("Service" or "App") created by Max van der Heijden. This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <h3>Usage Data</h3> 
        <p>The App may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p> 
        
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
        <p>The App does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the App may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their services.</p>
          
        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
        <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate my Service, provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or assist us in analysing how our Service is used.</p>
        <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
          
        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>The App uses third-party Services to show advertisements to you to help support and maintain my Service.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>AdMob by Google</h4>
              <p>You can opt-out from AdMob by following the instructions described by Google: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922</a></p>
              <p>For more information on how Google uses the collected information, please visit the "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or app" page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a> or visit the Privacy Policy of Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

          </ul>
        
        <h3>Payments</h3>
        <p>The App may provide paid products. In that case, I use third-party Services for payment processing ("payment processors").</p>
        <p>I will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to the third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.

        <h2>Security</h2> 
        <p>The security of your data is very important to me but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
        <p>In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, It will immediately be deleted. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take the necessary actions.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2> 
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
